### vTaiwan and Participation Officers (PO) network bring people directly into governance and help lawmakers implement decisions with a greater degree of legitimacy.

The nature of challenges that are most important right now are ones that donâ€™t have a single owner. It is our priority to tackle complex challenges that are crucial to our society and work collaboratively with all disciplines. In order to explore how we could all work and think together, Taiwan has been experimenting with bringing citizens and government together in a civic deliberation process for crafting legislation or policy at national scale. 

In the spirit of international exchange and with the support of the Taiwanese government, g0v vNetwork organizers are pleased to announce the first English language opportunity to learn how vTaiwan and PO network work, the design behind them and the difference, as well as their impacts so far.

This two day training in NYC will be highly interactive and led by a delegation from Taiwan, including: Digital Minister Audrey Tang and members of the Public Digital Innovation and Service team. We invite you to be an integral part of this inaugural opportunity!
