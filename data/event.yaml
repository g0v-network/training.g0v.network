    event: vTaiwan Open Consultation Process
    about: >
      <a href="https://info.vtaiwan.tw/">vTaiwan</a> is a public-fund, private-operated community. vTaiwan is an open consultation process that brings Taiwan citizens and government together in online and offline spaces. There are various collaborative open source engagement tools used in vTaiwan that shapes an interactive environment based on evolving rough consensus. “vTaiwan culture” is drawn from open source culture, strongly adhering to principles of transparency and collaboration, self-organization and distributed responsibility. vTaiwan is also an open space, a combination of time and space run by participants to work on cases brought in.

        title: History of vTaiwan
        blurb: In December 2014, the then Minister without Portfolio, Jaclyn Tsai, attended a hackathon organized by g0v— the largest civic tech community in Asia—and requested g0v contributors to build a platform that would allow the entire Taiwan society to engage in “rational discussion” of public matterers at a national scale. Tsai’s proposal kick-started vTaiwan. To date, 25 national issues have been discussed through the vTaiwan open consultation process, and more than 80% have led to decisive government action.
