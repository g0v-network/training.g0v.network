    event: vTaiwan Open Consultation Process
    about: "vTaiwan is an open consultation process that brings Taiwan citizens and government together to craft country-wide digital legislation. The ‘v’ in vTaiwan stands for “vision”, “voice”, “vote” and “virtual”, as vTaiwan
embarks on a “virtual venture” of open consultation with citizens. “vTaiwan culture” is drawn from open source culture, strongly adhering to principles of transparency and collaboration, self-organization and distributed responsibility."

        title: History of vTaiwan
        blurb: In December 2014, the then Minister without Portfolio, Jaclyn Tsai, attended a hackathon organized by g0v— the largest civic tech community in Asia—and requested g0v contributors to build a platform that would allow the entire Taiwan society to engage in “rational discussion” of public matterers at a national scale. Tsai’s proposal kick-started vTaiwan. To date, 25 national issues have been discussed through the vTaiwan open consultation process, and more than 80% have led to decisive government action.
